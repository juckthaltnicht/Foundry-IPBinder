# Foundry - IPBinder

This modification is for the game [Foundry](https://store.steampowered.com/app/983870/FOUNDRY/).
Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to assign a IP to the server version of the game, but this is possible with this project.


## Installation

Download the latest [version](https://github.com/juckthaltnicht/Foundry-IPBinder/releases/tag/master). 

Then unzip the IPBinder folder and install it on your server in ```YOURSERVER/Mods```

If the “Mods” folder does not exist, simply create it.
    
## Usage

Go to app.cfg, which you will find in the main directory of your server.

There you can now add the setting ```connect_to=```

You can then enter the desired IP after the "="

## Example 
```connect_to=127.0.0.1```
